# 42cursus' CPP Modules

## Introduction

Welcome to the CPP Modules of the 42cursus curriculum! These modules serve as an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using the C++ language. Whether you're new to programming or experienced in other languages, these modules will help you grasp fundamental OOP concepts and techniques.

### Why C++?

C++ was chosen as the language for these modules due to its roots in C and its widespread use in various industries. While C++98 is the standard used here to keep things simple, it's important to note that modern C++ has evolved significantly. As you progress through the modules and beyond the 42 Common Core, there's ample opportunity to explore and master modern C++ practices.

## Module Overview

These modules cover a range of topics essential for understanding and applying OOP principles in C++. Each module builds upon the previous one, gradually introducing new concepts and techniques. Here's a brief overview of what each module covers:

| Module | Topics Covered |
|--------|----------------|
| 00     | Namespaces, classes, member functions, initialization lists, static, const, and basic C++ syntax. |
| 01     | Memory allocation, pointers, references, switch statement, and more. |
| 02     | Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the Orthodox Canonical class form. |
| 03     | Inheritance and its implementation in C++. |
| 04     | Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. |
| 05     | Handling repetition and exceptions in C++. |
| 06     | C++ casting operators and their usage. |
| 07     | Understanding and utilizing C++ templates. |
| 08     | Templated containers, iterators, and algorithms in C++. |
| 09     | Introduction to the Standard Template Library (STL) and its components. |
